Hummingbird E200 Opensource Processor Core
================

About
-----------

This repository hosts the project for open-source hummingbird E200 RISC processor Core.

The Hummingbird E200 (32bits RISC processor core) was developed by "武汉聚芯微电子有限公司" and 
"北京九天微星科技发展有限公司", supporting part of RISC-V instruction set. 

The Hummingbird E200 core is a two-stages pipeline based ultra-low power/area implementation, 
which has both performance and areas benchmark better than ARM Cortex-M0+ core, makes the Hummingbird E200 as a perfect replacement for legacy 8051 core or ARM Cortex-M cores in the IoT or other ultra-low power applications. 

To boost the RISC-V popularity and to speed up the IoT development in China,
we are very proud to make it open-source. It is the first open-source processor core from
China mainland with industry level quality and state-of-art CPU design skills to support RISC-V instruction set.

Our ambition is to make "Hummingbird E200" become next 8051 in China, please go with us to make it happen.

Usages and Applications
-----------------------------

The open-source Hummingbird E200 core can be a perferct candidate for the following fields:
*   Replace legacy 8051 core for better performance.
*   Replace Cortex-M core for lower cost.
*   Also, the Hummingbird E200 core as a simple ultra-low power core and SoC, which is "蜂鸟虽小、五脏俱全", with detailed Docs and Software/FPGA Demos, hence, it will be a perfect example for lab practice in university or entry-level studying. 

Detailed Introduction
-----------------------------

We have provided very detailed introduction and quick start-up documents to help you ramping it up. 

The detailed introduction and the quick start documentation can be seen 
from e200_opensource/doc directory.

By following the guidences from the doc, you can very easily start to use Hummingbird E200 processor core and demo SoC.
